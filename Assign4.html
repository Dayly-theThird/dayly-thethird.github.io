    <h1>Injustice League</h1>
    <p> The Injustice League is a group of supervillains in the DC Comics universe. 
        The group was conceived by writer Elliot S. Maggin and artist Mike Grell in 
        Justice League of America #111 (May 1974), though a different version of the team, 
        the Injustice Gang, had appeared in the Super Friends tie-in comic book series. 
        The Injustice League originally consisted of a 
        collection of villains loosely banded together to counter the
         Justice League of America. The group has changed its roster over the years, usually 
         as a foil to the current incarnation of the Justice League. The Injustice League has 
         appeared in various media adaptations, including television series and video games.</p>
